      <h2>Why choose slow fashion?</h2>
        <br>
          <p>The fast fashion industry is one of the most polluting and harmful industries in the world. By choosing slow fashion you will:</p>
          <div>
          <div id="list-items">
            <ul>
              <li><b>Reduce waste</b> â€“ huge amounts of fashion go to landfills, with about 60% of all clothing ending up there within a year of being made. If we shop second-hand, we will encourage retailers to produce less clothing, and will reduce the amount that is wasted and left for landfill.</li>
              <li><b>Save water</b> - it takes 700 gallons of water to make a single cotton tshirt (that's the amount a person normally consumes over a three year period). By buying longer-lasting clothing and less of it, we will waste less water.</li>
              <li><b>Lower our carbon footprint</b> - the fashion industry accounts for 8% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, due to the power used in production and in transportation. Choosing locally made clothing or swapping clothes/buying second hand will reduce your carbon footprint.</li>
              <li><b>Support animal welfare</b> - many animals are harmed by the pollutants which are released into the environment by the fashion industry, as chemicals used in clothing production accumulate in their water supply. By buying from sustainable brands you will be ensuring that your clothes have been made ethically.</li>
              <li><b>Support human rights</b> - retailers keep their clothing cheap by producing them in factories where there are poor conditions and low wages. By choosing sustainable fashion you will be refusing to condone this treatment of  workers, and supporting locals who are paid fair wages.</li>
            </ul>
