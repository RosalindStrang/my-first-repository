      <h2>Why choose slow fashion?</h2>
          <p class="bold">The fast fashion industry is one of the most polluting and harmful industries in the world. By choosing slow fashion you will:</p>
          <div>
          <div id="list-items">
            <ul>
              <li><b>Reduce waste</b> â€“ huge amounts of fashion go to landfills, with about 60% of all clothing ending up there within a year of being made. If we shop second-hand, we will encourage retailers to produce less clothing, and will reduce the amount that is wasted and left for landfill.</li>
              <li><b>Save water</b> - it takes 700 gallons of water to make a single cotton tshirt (that's the amount a person normally consumes over a three year period). By buying longer-lasting clothing and less of it, we will waste less water.</li>
              <li><b>Lower our carbon footprint</b> - the fashion industry accounts for 8% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, due to the power used in production and in transportation. Choosing locally made clothing or swapping clothes/buying second hand will reduce your carbon footprint.</li>
              <li><b>Support animal welfare</b> - many animals are harmed by the pollutants which are released into the environment by the fashion industry, as chemicals used in clothing production accumulate in their water supply. By buying from sustainable brands you will be ensuring that your clothes have been made ethically.</li>
              <li><b>Support human rights</b> - retailers keep their clothing cheap by producing them in factories where there are poor conditions and low wages. By choosing sustainable fashion you will be refusing to condone this treatment of  workers, and supporting locals who are paid fair wages.</li>

  <h2>What can I do to help?</h2>
    <p class="bold"> Here are our top tips for reducing your fashion footprint:<p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <b>Buy second hand</b>
          <p>You don't just need to go to the high street when shopping! Look around your local charity shops to find preloved pieces - this is a great way to find rare, unique items and to save money at the same time</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <b>Swap with friends and family</b>
        <p>Always loved your best friend's dress which she's now bored of? A great way to save money and to update your wardrobe sustainably is to swap clothes with the people around you - that way you don't waste clothes which you don't want, and you get a whole new wardrobe in the process!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <b>Learn to sew</b>
        <p>Some basic tailoring skills will mean that you can repair clothes so that they last longer, and also alter them completely - this way you can have a brand new item without buying anything at all</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <b>Quality not quantity</b>
        <p>Buy clothes that are durable and made to last so that you won't have to end up throwing them out in a few months' time</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <b>Only buy it if you feel GREAT</b>
        <p>Make sure that you only buy clothes that you are sure you will wear time and time again - this ensures that they won't end up being wasted at the back of your closet, and eventually going to landfill</P>
